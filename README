Instructions for use of this class file
=======================================

	You will need to get an EPS version of the IFAAMAS logo, and place it in the directory
	of the work you're trying to compile.  I will find whether I'm allowed to commit it to
	git, but until I get permission I'm afraid you'll have to source it yourself (I simply
	used a JPG from a previous abstract book and used the GIMP to convert it).

	There are a couple of commands that you should call in the preamble.

		\conferencenumber{ } - Takes one argument, which is the number of the conference
					e.g \conferencenumber{10$^\matrhm{th}$}

		\conferenceyear{ } - Takes one argument, which is the year of the conference
					e.g \conferenceyear{2010}

		\location{ } - Takes one argument, which is the city and country of the conference
					e.g \location{Toronto, Canada}

		\dates{ } - Takes one argument, which is the range of dates the conference is on
					e.g \dates{10--14th May}

		\isbn{ } - Takes one argument, which is the ISBN of the abstract book
					e.g \isbn{123-4-12341234-1-2}


	The following commands are defined for use within the document body.

		\section{Title}
			Places a heading horizontally centred in the page.

		\day{Date}
			Creates a heading denoting a new day.

		\session{Topic}{Chair}
			Creates a heading that specifies a new session on `Topic',
			that is being chaired by `Chair'.

		\session*{Title}{PaperPrefix}
			Creates a session with title `Title', resets paper counters
			to zero, and prefixes the numbers of papers defined after 
			this command with PaperPrefix--.

		\paper{Title}{Authors}
			Creates a heading for a paper with title `Title', authored by
			`Authors'.  The abstract of the paper should follow this command.

		\backmatter
			This should be placed at the end of the document before \printindex
	
Building the document
=====================
	
	After long hours spent trying to get latex to build an authors index for me, I gave up
	and decided just to write a PERL script that parses the document looking for \paper{}{} lines
	then generating \index{} commands from the authors specified in that.

	The script that does this is called expandAuthors.pl, which you use as follows
	
		cat myAbstracts.tex | expandAuthors.pl > myAbstracts_expandex.tex
	
	Simple (if all goes to plan).

	There is another script called buildbook.sh, which you can use in the following manner
		
		buildbook.sh myAbstracts.tex

	This will create a variety of files, mostly prefixed with book_.  The most exciting one
	is book_expanded.dvi, which is the compiled version of your abstracts book.  You can convert
	this to pdf using a tool such as dvipdfm.

		dvipdfm book_expanded.dvi
	
	This script is very basic and assumes you've put all of your papers into one massive file 
	(which isn't advisable) however if you keep watching this space no doubt I'll modify it to
	work with multiple files when I come around to building the abstract books myself.  For now, 
	you can use it to get an idea of how to build the document.

	Good luck,  if you have any problems contact me at harry __ at __ harryrose.org
